# this question expects a textual answer and not generation of code. #
What are the values of A, B and C as computed by the script below?

```envision
table T = with
  [| as X |]
  [| 1 |]
  [| 2 |]
  [| 3 |]

where T.X != 2
  show scalar "A" with sum(T.X) // ?

  where T.X != 1
    show scalar "B" with sum(T.X)  // ?

show scalar "C" with sum(T.X)  // ?
```

# ANSWER

The value A is computed within the first `where` block, due to the 2-whitespace indent, which filters out the value 2. Thus, we have the values 1 and 3 left. Thus, A = 1 + 3 = 4.

The value B is computed within the two nested `where` block, due to the 4-whitespace indent, which are filtering out the value 2 (first filter) and the value 1 (second filter). Thus, we only have the value 3 left. Thus, B = 3.

The value C is computed outside any `where` block, as there is no indent, thus all 3 values are included. Thus, C = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

In summary:

* A = 4
* B = 3
* C = 6
