Let's display, as text, an expression "y = a * x + b" where `a` and `b` are replaced by their numerical values. The goal is to have the text composed dynamically based on the number values of `a` and `b`. Here, for the sake of the example, take `a = 13` and `b = 7`.

# ANSWER

```envision
// Define the variables 'a' and 'b'
a = 13
b = 7

// Beware, don't forget the `\` for the interpolation
expr = "y = \{a} * x + \{b}"

// Alternatively, it can be done with concatenation (less elegant)
expr = concat("y = ", text(a), " * x + ", text(b))

// Display the expression
show scalar "My Expression" with expr
```
