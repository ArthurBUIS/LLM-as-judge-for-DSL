Create a table Catalog containing 3 columns : 10 "item"s and their "OrderDate" and "DeliveryDate" (the dates should be in date data type). Define a new column "Leadtime" for each item. Finally, show the table containing each item with their Leadtime, but only for those with Leadtime longer than 20 days.

# ANSWER

```envision
  table Catalog = with
  [| as Item, as OrderDate, as DeliveryDate |]
  [| "item1", date(2022, 1, 1), date(2022, 1, 15) |]
  [| "item2", date(2022, 2, 5), date(2022, 2, 20) |]
  [| "item3", date(2022, 3, 10), date(2022, 3, 30) |]
  [| "item4", date(2022, 4, 15), date(2022, 5, 5) |]
  [| "item5", date(2022, 5, 20), date(2022, 6, 10) |]
  [| "item6", date(2022, 6, 25), date(2022, 7, 20) |]
  [| "item7", date(2022, 7, 30), date(2022, 8, 25) |]
  [| "item8", date(2022, 8, 5), date(2022, 8, 30) |]
  [| "item9", date(2022, 9, 10), date(2022, 9, 30) |]
  [| "item10", date(2022, 10, 15), date(2022, 11, 5) |]

Catalog.Leadtime = Catalog.DeliveryDate - Catalog.OrderDate // the date Leadtime is calculated by DeliveryDate - OrderDate

where Catalog.Leadtime > 20  // since Leadtime is in date data type, it can be directly compared to a number.
  show table "Items with Leadtime > 20 days" a1c11 with  // the filter must be done by must a two-block indentation under the where statement.
    Catalog.Item
    Catalog.Leadtime
