Create a table Catalog containing 2 columns : "item" and their "itemcolor". Create another table ColorPrices that associates a "color" to its "price" (we assume that each item of same color has same price). All colors figuring in "itemcolor" column of Catalog should show up in the color column of ColorPrices.  
Add a column "itemprice" to Catalog containing the price of each item in Catalog.  
Show each item in Catalog with their price.
You are not allowed to use filter; use primary dimension to index ColorPrices by color.

# ANSWER

```envision
table Catalog = with // it is optional to index Catalog by item
  [| as item, as itemcolor |]
  [| "Shirt", "red" |]
  [| "Hat", "blue" |]
  [| "Shoes", "red" |]
  [| "Pants", "green" |]

// declare a primary dimension "color" by []
table ColorPrices[color] = with
  [| as color, as price|]
  [|   "red",  15      |]
  [|   "green",  10      |]
  [|   "blue",  8      |]

// add column containing itemprice
Catalog.itemprice=ColorPrices.price[Catalog.itemcolor]// beware, first take the price column, then index by itemcolor. Reversing the order is wrong.

// Show the Price of the items
show table "Red Items" a1b3 with
  Catalog.item as "Item"
  Catalog.itemprice as "Price"
```
