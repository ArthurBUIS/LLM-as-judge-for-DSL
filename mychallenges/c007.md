Define a table Students with 5 names, each associated to a teacher and a score. 3 of the 5 students should follow the teacher named "John Doe".
Add a column to the Students table to indicate if a student is successful. A student is regarded successful if the score is strictly better than 79.
In a table, show John Doe's successful students' information, including their mean score, their best score and the student that achieves the best score. 

# ANSWER

```envision
      table Students = with
  [| as name, as teacher, as score |]
  [| "Sally","John Doe",98 |]
  [| "Mike","John Doe",79 |]
  [| "Andrew","Manuel Joffre",70 |]
  [| "Nathan","Marie Curie",80 |]
  [| "John","John Doe",93 |]

Students.success=if Students.score>79 then true else false // acceptable but too long
Students.success=Students.score>79 // the shorter version

// add a filter. The 2-space start-of-line is mandatory to mark the field of the filter.
where Students.teacher=="John Doe"  and Students.success
  meanscore=mean(ranvar(Students.score)) 
  Maxscore=max(Students.score) 
  bestname=argmax(Students.score, Students.name)
  success_count=count(Students.success) // count shall always be deployed on a boolean column.

// show the information as a table
show table "John Doe's students' info" with 
  success_count as "successful students count" 
  meanscore as "mean"
  Maxscore as "maxscore"
  bestname as "best student"
