We will consider a time span from 01/Jan/2005 to 31/Jan/2005. Create a table `Products` with 3 columns `Name`, `Origin` and `Factor` of several rows. Then, cross the table `Product` with `date`. Make up a column `Quantity` to the crossed table by each product.  

# ANSWER

```envision

keep span date = [ date(2005, 1, 1) .. date(2005, 1, 31) ]

table Products[name, origin] = with
  [| as Name, as Origin,   as Factor |]
  [| "banana",   "Morocco",    1.6     |]
  [| "apple",    "France",     2.1      |]
  [| "orange",   "Germany",    2.3     |]
  [| "melon",    "China",      2.7     |]
  
table PD = cross(Products, Day)
 
// Made-up quantities varying per product and per date
// Products.Price and date is broadcasted to the cross table PD
PD.Quantity = (date - date(2021, 1, 1)) * Products.Price
```
